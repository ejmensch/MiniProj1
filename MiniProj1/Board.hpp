	/* this method and the moveDog method are probably the longest methods.
	* This method first puts dummy values in every square (I used '+' - I just didn't want
	* every square to have gibberish, so I chose a character I wasn't using for any other
	* purpose and initialized every square to have that value).
	* I then added my random horizontal and vertical walls.
	*
	* Here's how I did it the walls:
	*
	* I only placed walls in the odd numbered rows and columns (in other words, row one might
	* have a row, but then row 2 would not, whereas row three could and row 4 could not.
	* Same with columns (although you can have flexibility.
	*
	* I picked an odd row or column that did not already have a wall in it at all.
	*
	4
	* I generated a total of 10 walls.
	* For each wall, I picked randomly for vertical or horizontal (just rand() % 2 to get either
	* 0 for vertical, 1 for horizontal.
	*
	* I set the easy version to have at most 9 squares in a row or column as a wall, the
	* medium to have at most 13 squares as walls in a row or column, and the hard version to
	* have at most 16 squares per row or column.(but you can play with this because sometimes
	* the hard version was seriously hard!!!
	*
	* Let's say I randomly decided to place a wall in row 3. I then randomly chose 9 squares in
	* row 3 to be a wall (if it was the easy version, 13 if it was the medium, and 16 if it was
	* the hard)
	*
	* So that's the walls. Then I added the 'D' to the beginning square nad an 'E' to the end
	square.

	void printBoard();
	/* this method first uses the dog's printDog method to print out info about the dog, and then
	* it prints out the board as follows:
	*
	* This method prints out hte board such that it looks like a board. It prints a blank space
	* for the dummy values (for squares that do not have food, traps, walls, the dog, and aren't the
	* beginning or the ending. Otherwise it prints out the character in the square.
	* Note that I printed a border around the entire board so it was easier to look at, and, equally,
	* I placed an -> arro (thats a minus and a greater than sign) in the border for where the
	* beginning of the game was and where the end of the game was. E.g., this is what my starting
	* printBoard printed: (Note this is after I called addFood and addTraps)

	/* Note: Debug Mode:
	* The board class has a debug field. For every example I showed you, I had the
	* debug field set to true.
	*
	* When the debug field is set to true, the Traps are printed out. This makes the game easier
	* to test (and a lot easier to play). However, if the debug mode is set to false, the Traps
	* are not printed out unless the Dog steps on a trap, at which point they randomly lose points.
	* So when not in debug mode, the printBoard prints " " for every 'T' character on the board.
	* When the game is in debug mode, though, the printBoard prints out the 'T'.

	5

	* saps from the dog is determined in the moveDog method when the dog moves on a Trap.

	void playGame();
	/* (I'm giving you this one)
	* this method loops for every move the dog makes. It asks whether the user wants to move up,
	* down, left, or right. It then calls the moveDog method with the character indicating which
	* way the dog should move, and then it calls the printBoard method.
	*/
	bool moveDog(char c);
	/* This is a somewhat long method.
	* First, it determines the new coordinats of the dog, based on teh direction in which the
	* dog wants to move (based on what c holds - u is up, d is down, l is left, r is right).
	*
	* If the dog is at teh edge of the board, teh dog should not move
	*
	* If the dog moves over food, a random number between 2 and 17 is generated, and the
	* dog's changeStrength method is used to increase the dog's strength by the random amount.
	*
	* If the dog moves over the end of the board, the dog's won method is called and false is
	* returned from this method.
	*
	* If the dog moves over a Trap, a random number between 2 and 17 is generated and the dog's
	* changeStrength method is called with that negative number. (Note that the changeStrength
	* method returns a boolean indicating whether the dog's strength has gone to 0 or less, and
	* thus the dog has died and the game is over. That boolean value is returned from this method).
	*
	* If the dog moves over a wall, the method checks to see if the dog has enough strength to
	* knock down the wall (I made it cost 6 strength points to knock down a wall). If the dog
	* has enough strength, the user is asked, "Do you want to knock down that wall?" If the user
	* responds "yes", then the wall is knocked down, the dog moves into that square, adn the dog's
	* strength decreases by 6. If the answer is "no", the dog loses 1 strength point, just because.
	*
	* If the dog moves into a blank square, the dog loses 2 strength points using the changeStrength
	* method (which, again, will return false if the dog has lost all their strength and died.
	*
	* NOTE: I am not concerned with the precise rules here. If you want to change the range of
	* random numbers for food, if you are worried about whether you still lose 2 strength points for
	* moving even though you gained points for moving over food - I'm leaving all that to your
	preference.
	* I am concerned that you are using classes, objects, and object methods and accessing object
	* fields correctly!
